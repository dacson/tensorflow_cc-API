A class to load tf models and do predict

Step 1:
  put tensorflow head files into ./include
  put libtensorflow_cc.so and libcudnn.so into ./lib
  # if do not have, uhm...
  # follow tensorflow home page or find other ways...

Step 2:
  put category.txt and model.pb in ./resource
  modify the operation name in TensorflowLoader::doPredict()
  ./build.sh
  # This may clean up and build:
    tf_api.o in ./obj
    gen in ./bin
    libtfloader.so and libtfloader.a in ./lib

Step 3:
  ./run.sh
